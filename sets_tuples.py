# # Sets##################################
# # Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# # Sets are mutable
# # Sets are defined by curly braces {}
# #example of sets
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set of integers
# set2 = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}  # set of strings
# set3 = {1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana'}  # mixed set
# set4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # duplicate elements are removed
# print(set1)
# print(set2)
# print(set3)
# print(set4)

# #access elements in a set
# # print(set1[0]) # Error: 'set' object does not support indexing
# for element in set1:
#     print(element)
# print(1 in set1)#Output:true
# print(6 in set1)#output: false
# print(len(set1))#output: 5
# print("strawberry" in set2)
# print("apple" in set3) #output:true
# # add elements to a set
# set1.add(6)
# print(set1)
# set2.add('orange')
# print(set2)
# set3.add(6)
# print(set3)
# set3.add(7)
# print(set3)
# set3.add('blueberry')
# print(set3)
# #remove elements from a set
# set1.remove(3)
# print(set1)
# set3.remove(2)
# print(set3)
# set3.remove('banana')
# print(set3)
# #check if an element is in a set
# print(3 in set1)
# print('banana' in set2)

# #find the length of a set
# print(len(set1))
# print(len(set2))
# print(len(set3))
# print(len(set4))


# #clear a set
# set1.clear()
# print(set1)
# id_numbers = (198, 25, 653, 334, 235)
# #remove first elemnt from the set
# id_numbers.pop()
# print(id_numbers)
#tuples##################################
# Tuples are ordered collections of elements
# Tuples are immutable
# Tuples are defined by parentheses ()
#example of tuples
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # tuple of integers
tuple2 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')  # tuple of strings
tuple3 = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')  # mixed tuple
tuple4 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # duplicate elements are allowed


#access elements in a tuple
print(tuple1[0])
print(tuple2[1])
print(tuple3[2])
print(tuple4[3])
#find the length of a tuple
print(len(tuple1))
print(len(tuple2))
print(len(tuple3))
print(len(tuple4))
#count the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple
print(tuple4.count(3)) # output: 2
print(tuple4.count(6)) # output:0
#find the index of an element in a tuple
print(tuple1.index(3)) # output: 2
print(tuple2.index('banana')) #output: 1

#convert a tuple to a list
print(list(tuple1)) #output: [1,2,3,4,5]

#convert a list to a tuple
print(tuple(list(tuple1))) #output: (1,2,3,4,5)

# Challenge: Count the number of occurrences of the character 'v' in the text below.
# The text is converted to a tuple of characters and the target characters are 'v' and 'V'.
# The result is output to the console.

text = """Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation
of a by-gone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and
vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.


The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.


Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me V."""
